# CodeForces Torture
Inspired by LeetCode Torture (https://github.com/The-CodingSloth/haha-funny-leetcode-extension), this extension redirects network requests to a CodeForces problem every day. After the problem is solved, you are free to use your browser for the rest of the day.

# Usage
- Download the repository (You do not need the Python files, but everything else should be included)
- Open the extensions page by entering chrome://extensions into a new tab
- Enable developer mode
- Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory
- The extension should now be active, click the extension icon on the taskbar to open the extension's settings menu
- Input the desired rating range and your CodeForces handle and click save
- Have fun! Or not.

Note: You may have to refresh the page when an Accepted verdict is found in order for the extension to detect the submission. Also, if any errors occur, simply re-inputing your settings into the settings menu and clicking save will usually fix the issue.
